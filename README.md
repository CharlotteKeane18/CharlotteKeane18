### Hi there 👋
I’m currently working on a group project about a family friednly paddle boarding game, a solo adventure game and a educational game for VR/AR.
I’m currently learning Unreal engine 5 with using blueprints and using Unity to create VR/AR game.
I’m looking to collaborate on any type of genre of game and gaining experience from others by working with a team.
I’m looking for help with better experience of programming
